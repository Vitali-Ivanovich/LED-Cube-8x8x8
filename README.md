# About LED Cube 8x8x8
LED Cube 8x8x8: software code, circuit design, simulation model.

# Software code
Source code written in the program "mikroC compiler for PIC" for PIÐ¡18F2550, includes all the necessary functions for LED Cube control, and over 20 lighting effects. For the controller firmware program has been used PICkit2 Programmer, but you can use any other suitable for the selected controller.

# Circuit board
Circuit board for the project prepared by the Sprint-6 Layouts and imported in standard Gerber format.

# Simulation model
Simulation model for debugging of operation of the circuit and check the effects of the prepared environment model is designed in the Proteus Design Suite 8.5.
